I emailed Columbia Gorge Toyota these photos to ask about the red paint
left for inspection reminder. The red paint could make it look wet. I\'m
not sure if it is leaking again at this point.

Replace the aluminum transmission output cover plate and o-ring.

-   00295-01281 Form-in-place-gasket (FIPG) silicone, Transmission Cover

A service representative brought me to the shop to show the damage to
the aluminum transmission cover plate and o-ring. The o-ring had been
reused and had RTV to help prevent the damaged cover plate from leaking.

New cover plate and o-ring were installed. I am unsure if RTV was used
with the o-ring/cover plate assembly the third repair.

This photo shows the input side of the transfer case. The technician has
removed the o-ring 96721-35063. Note the nicks and scratches on the
aluminum housing that holds the transfer case input shaft and oil seal.

This photo is a closeup of the transmission output. The aluminum ring
held by four bolts is part number 33121-35110 Transmission Cover. Notice
the scratches and residual RTV inside the cover and on the output shaft.

After inspection and discussion with Toyota, the service representative
asked to bring the truck back at the beginning of April, when the Toyota
field engineer would be onsite to determine the next course of action to
repair the leak.

I plan to call on March 25th to schedule an appointed with the field
engineer.
