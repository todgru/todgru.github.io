# Privacy Tools and Information

## Removing Data

- Privacy Workbook (Bazzell) https://inteltechniques.com/data/workbook.pdf Removing from the "top 10" sites often trickles down to many of the others. Contains information about setting up a credit freeze.
- Removing info from data broker sites: https://www.vice.com/amp/en/article/ne9b3z/how-to-get-off-data-broker-and-people-search-sites-pipl-spokeo This is similar to the list from Bazzell Privacy Workbook.

## Tools and Software

- https://privacytools.io/ A mix of education and tools, ranging from simple things like a browser change to more involved like self hosting file backups. A very useful list of resources. Open source, community maintained.

## Education

- Extreme Privacy Book (Bazzell) https://inteltechniques.com/book7.html Highly recommend. Many available strategies from mobile phones to private homes.
- "The New Oil" online privacy information https://thenewoil.xyz/ This is a dense read packed with useful information. Recommended. (blog https://write.as/thenewoil/)
- "How to Opt Out of the Sites That Sell Your Personal Data" https://www.wired.com/story/opt-out-data-broker-sites-privacy/ A good overview, but not as in-depth as other resources listed here.
