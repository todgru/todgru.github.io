# TodGru.com

All things todgru!

Website written in markdown. Based on Jekyll template from [Solo](http://chibicode.github.io/solo).

# Local development

From project directory, type `jekyll serve`

# Upload

Just push to Github repo `todgru.github.io`. https://todgru.com has a DNS A record point to Github hosting.

# PDF

A pdf converter plugin is available but needs work. Not quit working yet. More info [here](https://github.com/pdfkit/pdfkit/blob/master/README.md), [here](https://gist.github.com/kristianmandrup/5280569), and [here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/plugins/#converters).

I ended up using this website as I only needed to convert a single file to a pdf. <http://www.markdowntopdf.com/>.

TODO: resume md to pdf converter. probably a nodejs cli tool.
