### Not Work

I really like to [travel](../travel). I work remote when possible, spending time in Hawaii, Eastern Oregon and any place that is warm. Born in [Springfield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Springfield,_Oregon), I grew up in [Dexter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dexter,_Oregon). I was in a ska band, [The W's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_W%27s). Though technically part of a few double platinum albums, [_WOW 1999_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WOW_1999) & [_WOW 2000_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WOW_2000), the band only sold a few hundred thousand of [_Fourth From the Last_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_from_the_Last).
