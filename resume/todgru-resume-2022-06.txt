Senior Backend Software Engineer - Welocalize April 2017 - present


Welocalize is an international localization and translation service provider for Fortune 500 companies. 


Pantheon is Welocalize’s cloud-based client service delivery platform that manages translation projects, real-time integrations, and workflow management. Pantheon contains the entire day-to-day business of all client and vendor services. Data points are collected throughout the translation life cycle from intake to close to allow for revenue and delivery optimization. 


As an individual contributor at Welocalize, I was involved in many aspects to launch and improve the Pantheon platform: initial creation and transition from the legacy business process platform, new feature development, and scaling and performance improvements. My mandate was a holistic focus to create a reliable, efficient, and manageable distributed system.


* Collaborated with team to create Pantheon’s initial API framework and standardized code layout that produced faster feature delivery and testability.
* Led initiatives to create coding standards and best practices that increased code velocity, streamlined the code review process, and avoided anti-pattern pitfalls.
* Created testing initiative for full unit test coverage, including functional tests for business-critical happy paths. 
* Built Workday integration to manage project revenue, client purchase orders, and vendor resources.
* Deprecated legacy project management system and moved the existing workflow to Pantheon.
* Built hybrid microservice and monolith Node.js APIs to manage user, project, and vendor life cycles.
* Developed producer/consumer queue system using Node.js Bull for asynchronous processing. 
* Created developer tooling to manage Elasticsearch vendor resource search, a vital Pantheon function that quickly finds qualified translation resources based on translation task requirements. 
* Optimized SQL queries and refactored early versions of business algorithms to reduce API endpoint latencies by 60%.
* Mentored several junior engineers providing guidance that increased the contributor’s productivity.
